# üõ°Ô∏è Detection Engineering Lab: Atomic Red Team + Splunk + Sigma

This project simulates real-world adversary techniques using [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and detects them via [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) logs ingested into [Splunk Free](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html). Custom Sigma rules are written to map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and validate SOC workflows.

---

## üìå Goals

- Simulate adversary behavior mapped to MITRE ATT&CK using Atomic Red Team
- Collect and analyze logs with Splunk
- Write custom Sigma rules for each attack technique
- Demonstrate detection capability through dashboards, queries, and rule mapping
- Practice realistic SOC/detection engineering workflows

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo and prepare your lab environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/detection-lab-sigma.git
````

### 2. Install and configure tools

* [ ] Install **Splunk Free** locally
* [ ] Spin up a **Windows 10 VM**
* [ ] Install **Sysmon** using a recommended config (e.g., SwiftOnSecurity)
* [ ] Install **Winlogbeat** and forward logs to Splunk
* [ ] Install **Atomic Red Team** and test execution

See `/setup/` for detailed guides.

## üîç Sample Detection

### Technique: PowerShell Execution (T1059)

**Atomic Test:**

```powershell
Invoke-Expression -Command "Get-Process"
```

**Splunk Query:**

```spl
index=winlogs EventCode=4104 Message="Invoke-Expression*" OR ScriptBlockText="*Get-Process*"
```

**Sigma Rule:**
`detections/t1059-powershell-execution.yml`

## üìä Dashboards & Visuals

Screenshots and exported dashboards are available in `/dashboards/` and `/screenshots/`.
Example views:

* Suspicious PowerShell activity over time
* MITRE technique coverage heatmap
* Alert table from Sigma queries
